I have a PhD in Computer Science from Rice University. My thesis work, supervised by [Lydia Kavraki](https://www.cs.rice.edu/~kavraki/) and [Anastasios Kyrillidis](http://akyrillidis.github.io/about/), revolved around motion planning algorithms for high-DOF robots under realistic environments. For my doctoral studies, I received a [Fulbright Scholarship](https://us.fulbrightonline.org/) in 2019.

I am interested in understanding how to plan safe motions for robots in unstructured environments. My goal is to provide robots with the capabilities of autonomously deciding and acting in environments that may have noisy or incomplete information or where humans may be present. To this end, I have explored the use of optimization and learning-based methods into robot motion planning to enable safe and efficient robot motion.

Before joining Rice, I was an instructor and researcher at [Universidad de los Andes](https://uniandes.edu.co/en) and [Universidad Santo Tomás](https://www.usta.edu.co/#) where I thaught courses mainly in Electronic Engineering, Robotics and Machine Learning. During this time I had the chance to join the [RoboCup](https://www.robocup.org/) community by becoming part of the STOx's team of the [Small Size League](https://www.robocup.org/leagues/7) (2014-2017), serving as TC member in 2018 and by co-founding the [SinfonIA](https://www.facebook.com/SinfoniaUniandes/) team of the [@Home Social Standard Platform League](https://www.robocup.org/leagues/15) in 2019.
